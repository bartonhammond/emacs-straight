First off, if the data is available for user, then why not have the
Tutorial match exactly? Why have discrepancy?

Step 1: Upload Loggle Sample Data

* Has a link to  https://www.loggly.com/docs/loggly-sample-data/:

In the "Verify" step it shows "tag:sample" in blue box but screen shot has
"tag:file_upload" - very confusing - I missed the "tag:sample" as I
was focused on the PNG.

Again, why the discrepancy between screen shots and my data - how do I
know if I am doing things right if the numbers don't match and the
screen looks different?

On this page, the PNG shows "tag:file_upload" and "999 Events Dec 3" but my
screen says "7,453 events" w/ no Date.

The screen itself also doesn't match the current product making it
difficult to determine if I'm on the correct page or what?

* Step 2:
Again, the UI does not match my UI nor the number of events.  This PNG
shows "6,701, Events Dec 17-18" mine just says "7,453 events" and the
bar has "Feb 9 -10".  Nothing matches.


* Step 3: Zoom in on events. "And then dragging w/ your mouse" - how
to do that?

I held down mouse on blue column and moved to right but then nothing
was displayed.

How do I go back?  I tried Search again but the search From To fields
are already populated?  Don't know how to reset.  I tried clearing the
From field and then clicking Search but get error "Invalid From Value"

Couldn't go backwards so I just killed the tab.

Started over by created a new tab and entering "tag:sample"

I tried double clicking the bar and it changed perspective and did it
again until I see 2 bars.  If I double click on to one bar it expands
but then the data from the other bar is missing?

Ah - I now see the "reset" in the top right corner of the graph - that
should be pointed out in the Tutorial.

So I reset and then just double click until I'm seeing 7453.  But
could not figure out the "drag column" thing.

Again, the PNG show "6,701 Events Dec 18" : I have no data for Dec
18.

* The next couple of steps were ok.

* Step 6

Has a link to https://www.loggly.com/docs/trends/ and again the PNG
doesn't match the product.  It took me some time to figure out where
the Timeline Trend
