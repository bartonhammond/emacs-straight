Facebook ReactNative Jest: Test class includes Node Module that needs mocking

* How do you test a component that references a Node Module?

##Class under test:

### The class is ErrorAlert.js -
 1) the sole purpose is to display an error message
 2) it interogates the object to find the message
 3) it calls a Node Module to display the alert
   a) Look at node_modules/react-native-simpledialog-android
   b) Simple iOS or Android alert is called

### So what does the Jest test?

1) That ErrorAlert successfully finds the error message
2) That the react-native-simpledialog-android alert method is called

### How do we determine the react-native-simpledialog-android alert message is called?
1) We mock react-native-simpledialog-android
   a) node_modules are mocked at the root level
   b) use the same name as
   node_module/react-native-simpledialog-android
   c) use ```jest.genMockFunction()```
   d) can validate function was called now


### In testing class
1) use ```autoMockOff()```
2) inform jest that the react-native-simpledialog-android is mocked
3)
