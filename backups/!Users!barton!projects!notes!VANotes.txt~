I am a 62 year old, Viet Nam era veteran, 100% disabled male who is
not getting proper health care from the VA because they say I travel
our great country in a RV.

When I received treatment in Columbia, MO,
the VA (the best VA I've ever been to!) for an infected Total Knee Transplant
and also cancer of the Thyroid, it was great!  I parked my RV at a
park in Columbia for a year to receive proper medical treatment of
which I have no complaint.

Now I am in Port Aransas, TX and require follow up care for the
Thyroid.   The ENT department
