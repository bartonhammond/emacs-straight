Note: this application was written following the Package based structure

A blank meteor application with some boilerplate that was born out of [this 
hackpad](https://meteor.hackpad.com/Building-Large-Apps-Tips-d8PQ848nLyE) that 
incorporates current best practices for creating a modular, all-packages app
and promotes a specific workflow that makes working with a large code-base much 
more manageable.

The packages/app-lib/package.js has all the required packages loaded such as webix and iron-router.

The application is defined w/in the packages/app-core/ directory - see the package.js to see which files are loaded in what order and to which environment (client or server or both).
