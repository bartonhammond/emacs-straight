# Need to verify that the store contains all the state.

So I worked on a Hot Reload - the ability to save the state of the
running application.  This is NOT using a database but rather the
Redux store.  I assume in this presentation you're familiar with
Redux.

* Open a simulator.
* Be sure to "Debug With Chrome"
2 Enter login parameters with errors
3 Click mark and use Chrome console to get structure
4 Save in json.json - set editing mode
5 Reload the simlator
6 Copy / Paste in and Update State

Login with parameters
Make sure that the SessionToken is in the State
Save State

Simulator -> Reset Content and Savings
Hardware -> Connect Keybord
Paste in the Login Parameters
Update the profile
This proves you have the client id and session token

Code Walk through
1) src/components/Header
2) On mark - action.getState
3) Look at Login.js - show imported actions
4) src/reducers/global/GloalState - getState
5) where did store come from?
6) src/native.js - setStore is from global/globalActions
7) walk through globalReducer/GET_STATE
8)
