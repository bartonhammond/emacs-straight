I no longer want to associate w/ Wade Hammond

He is a vile and vulgar man.  He dispises me and hesitates not to
embarress me.  He has not respect for my accomplishments or the
character that I have.

Some of my accomplishments:

High School Honor Role every single semester
Honor Band
Orchestra
Varsity Wrestler freshmen and shopmore years
Eagle Boyscout
Senior Patrol Leader when Historic Trails and 50 Mile award
Drove semi-end dump truck and lowboy for 3 years in SF area w/o
incident
3 marathon runs w/ best at 3:17 which is significant
College Graduate Bachelor Science Computer Science
Graduated w/ honors: Cum Laude 3.48 / 4
Sole developer of Vyvx Inc system
IBM - 3 patents as sole inventor
IBM - awarded highest honor for software: Technical Acheivement Award
Heavily recruited by companies such as Home Away, IBM, 21 CT, Hewlett
Packard, etc.
Married 29 years

And Wade:
He cheated on my mother Peggy and deserted 3 children
He cheated on Mavis with multiple women
Introducted me to these women while still married to Mavis
Propositioned my girlfriend Carmel to have sex w/ him when I asked him
to give her a ride home
He introduces me as a drunk in jail to his neighbors
He incessantly belittles me and cuts me down.


I want nothing more to do w/ this person.  He means nothing to me.  I
am done w/ him.

As my mother said, he can go to HELL.
