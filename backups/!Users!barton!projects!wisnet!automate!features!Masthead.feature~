Feature: masthead has menu options
   Each page has menu links to other pages
   As a customer or admin I need to choose these links

Scenario: The menu options when not logged in
   Given I have a browser
   And I am not logged in
   When I go to the "home" page
   Then I should see "Course Catalog" link
   Then I should see "My Account" link
   Then I should see "Login" link
