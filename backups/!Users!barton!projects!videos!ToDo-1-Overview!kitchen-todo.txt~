Code generator for meteor.  It uses a single JSON file as it's input
and generates tons of boilerplate code helping you get a running
application with minimal effort.  

Take menu option "Getting Started"
   It appears you do the work of writing the JSON by hand.  You can
   but we wont

Take menu Examples
   These examples are all built from JSON file.  They are a great
   reference point

Take API Reference
   If you're writting the JSON yourself, this is a great API
   reference.  Again, we'll not be writing it ourselves.

Take What's UP
   We are currently using 0.9.36.  There are some bugs...

So let's register/login and start (I've already registered so we'll skip
that step.  Instead I'll log in)

Now that we've registered/logged in we are presented with the
development environment.  Let's take a tour.

On this main page, you can start the creation of your application.
Rather then writting JSON by hand, Meteor Kitchen provides a simple
user interface to interact.  By entering data via the web, the
application JSON file will be automatically generated.

Let's select my existing Todo and see what we have.

The first option is the Designer - this where we'll do most of the
work.  We'll be digging around the JSON struction via this interface.
Fortunately the interface provides some help instructions.


Since I already have my Todo application we'll select it and take a
tour.
