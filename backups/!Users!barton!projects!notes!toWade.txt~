I've tried having a mature father/son relationship with you and it just isn't
working - it's not healthy: you find enjoyment in pointing out my faults, bringing up
embarrassing events from my past, cutting and belittleing me and in
general treating me with indignation.  You have done this all my life - reminding me and anyone who
listens how I've failed at this or that. And you think it's funny and don't hesitate to do so in public
even with strangers.  

Everytime we are together for any extended period of time, you eventually needle and poke and put me
down and through continual belittlemnt push me to the point that I
just lose control as I just can't take it any more. And I'm not even
sure you realize you do it - it's just who you are!  If I were to protest each
and every time you belittled me, you'd say I just can't take a joke. To you, embarrasing and
humiliating me is a joke.

You take absolutely no ownership or responsibility in contribting to the
caustic heated exchanges we have.  Seems like everytime we leave after
visiting there's been a blow up between us.    

"Out of the abundance of your heart, your mouth speaks".  What I hear
you say about me when I am in your presence leads me to believe you don't respect
me nor are proud or supportive of me; you don't agree with how I live or
who I am - most everything I do you find some kind of fault with.  It
appears to me that in your heart you really don't even like me - why
else would you say the hurtful things you do?  Shouldn't you treat
others as you would like to be treated?
