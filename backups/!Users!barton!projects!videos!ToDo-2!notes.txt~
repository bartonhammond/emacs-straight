We will create the Todo app by selecting Create

The next screen provides input for the name of the app.

With the Designer selecting application, let's review some options and
make some changes.

Application

1). The first change is the Theme.  Meteor Kitchen has themes for
Bootstrap from https://bootswatch.com/. Select the theme and see those
available.  We'll pick the bootswatch-paper which has features of the
Google Material Design specifications.

2) With Login With Password - the default is checked - just verify for
now

3) Save the changes - scroll to the bottom and click save

Application -> Public Zone -> Pages -> Home Public -> Components ->
Home_JumboTron

We want to override two fields
A. The Text field with changes that point to our GitHub acccount.

From: 
<b>This <a href="https://www.meteor.com" target="_blank">Meteor</a>
application is made with <a href="http://www.meteorkitchen.com"
target="_blank">meteor-kitchen</a> without manual coding.</b><br />It
demonstrates how to create application with login, register and forgot
password functions.<br />Source code (input file for generator) is <a
href="https://github.com/perak/kitchen-examples/tree/master/example-accounts"
target="_blank">here</a>.

B. More importantly, we change the Button Route from Login to
Register. Select it from the drop downs.

The public facing website is now ok for our purposes.

The next thing to do is change the private side of the application.
The default page for the private side is home_private

See Application -> Private Zone -> Pages -> home_private
